# stress-strain

Almost all metals behave like elastic objects over a specific range. This range varies for different metals and is affected by factors such as mechanical properties, atmospheric exposure (corrosion), grain size, heat treatment, and working temperature.

Initially, the material follows Hooke's law. The strain will be proportional to stress. It means that the ratio of stress to strain will be a constant (Young's Modulus of Elasticity).

As the material moves towards plastic region of deformation, the relationship of stress-strain would follow the equation : σ = a+bε^(n), where σ is the stress, ε is the plastic strain. a, b, n are the constants of the expression of plastic behavior.

Now We have created a model which analyses and predicts this graph using various ML techniques.
